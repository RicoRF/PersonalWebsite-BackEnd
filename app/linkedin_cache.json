My journey started at just 12 years old, teaching myself web development and design, and I\u2019ve never stopped learning and growing since.\n\nAt 15, I started freelancing, where I specialized in fixing, customizing, and optimizing WordPress sites. From creating child themes and plugins to enhancing loading speed and solving complex technical issues, I\u2019ve gained deep expertise in HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, jQuery, PHP, MySQL, and WHM/cPanel. Working closely with clients, I quickly learned the importance of clear communication and understanding client needs\u2014skills that have shaped the way I approach every project.\n\nBy 19, I partnered with Just One Dime, a global coaching company for eCommerce sellers, where I developed and launched eCommerce websites for their clients. This role helped me refine my ability to work one-on-one with clients, solving problems and delivering results that aligned with their business goals. The positive feedback from these clients has been a testament to my dedication to creating value, which you can see reflected in the recommendations on my profile.\n\nAt 22, I took on the challenge of leading a design team at Victoria eCom, a fast-paced company focused on branding and online retail. Leading the design process for over 600 product assets, including packaging and manuals, I honed my leadership, teamwork, and attention-to-detail. Managing multiple projects simultaneously taught me the importance of clear communication and maintaining structure from start to finish.\n\nIn 2022, I embarked on a new chapter by immigrating to Canada and enrolling in the IT Programmer-Analyst program at New Brunswick Community College. Here, I deepened my knowledge of object-oriented programming, systems analysis and design, project management, entrepreneurship, Linux, and Amazon Web Services (AWS). I've learned how applications work from the ground up using three-tier architecture, which has been a great complement to my web development skills.\n\nNow, I\u2019m excited to bring my years of experience, technical knowledge, and passion for web development to the Canadian job market. I\u2019m eager to contribute, learn, and grow as part of a dynamic team. I\u2019m confident that my blend of freelancing, team leadership, and recent studies make me a strong asset in any project or organization.", "photoUrl":

I was referred to Federico from a business partner and could not have been more pleased and at times even blown away. \n\nThroughout the entire process of choosing a name, registering it, planning a website, building it out, and perhaps the most difficult part, maintaining it, Federico has been second to none including major companies I\u2019ve worked with all the way down to local designers and hosting companies.\n\nFederico has an amazing combination of professional and technical prowess while also being able to explain these concepts in simplistic ways, so that a business owner like myself doesn\u2019t get bogged down in details or feel confused or ever felt \u201cleft alone\u201d. The thing that stood out the most to me with working with Federico was how quickly he would respond to problems, and no matter how dumb I felt my questions were, Federico answered them all with a jovial and friendly attitude! \n\nI\u2019ve never had a technical problem or any issue with my website being down, not working, or any my email systems being down or not working with him. At any moment that I had any technical difficulties, no matter how minor, Federico was always available the same day to either get on the phone and speak with me or to get on the Internet and fix whatever issues were going on.\n\nIf you\u2019re an entrepreneur like myself and you have a lot of things going on and have very little knowledge about hosting and websites and email there\u2019s not a single person you can find better fit for you than Federico. His amazing intellect in his field mixed with his amazingly down to earth attitude produces a truly best friend mentality and experience. The way he takes care of his clients, has absolutely blown me away, especially at his young age. In fact, even very large large scale websites that I\u2019ve had to consult on, before speaking to those large companies and designers Federico is still the first person I\u2019d call to run things by and he has always been very aware of his limitations of either A. this is something I can help you with directly or B. let me help you find someone else! Never selfish, never greedy. His concept of a \u201cbest friend\u201d company has blown me away. It\u2019s been second to none you will not be disappointed working with Federico at any level.\nRespectfully, \nJohn M. Billington IV. ", "authorFullname": "John M.
